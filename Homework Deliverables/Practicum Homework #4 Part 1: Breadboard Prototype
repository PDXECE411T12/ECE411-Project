Version 1.0

Part 1: Breadboard Prototype

Current Status:

Modeling:
A CAD model of the doorlock housing has been created and 3D printed. The design may be refined slighlty but is nearing final stages of development. Development of
final circuit board has not started yet in EAGLE CAD. Only known component that needs to be on PCB currently is an ESP12E processor. 

Electronic Components:
The processor reads and identifies different RFID cards flawlessly. Output logic signal from reading an RFID card needs to be changed from active high to edge triggered.
Power source has not been finalized, but the servo and processor can run on 3.3V, allowing for use of AA or 9V batteries, or USB to power system.
