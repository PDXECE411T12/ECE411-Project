# Part 1: Prototype Design

Current Status:

# Electronic Components:
The processor reads and identifies different RFID cards flawlessly. Output logic signal from reading an RFID card needs to be changed 
from active high to edge triggered. Power source has not been finalized, but the servo and processor can run on 3.3V 
(although a slightly higher voltage would be prefered), allowing for use of AA or 9V batteries, or USB to power the system.

# Housing:
A CAD model has been designed and 3D printed to hold the doorlock and electronic components. This model may be refined slightly, 
but is close to its final iteration.
